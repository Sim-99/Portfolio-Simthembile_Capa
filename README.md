## Introduction

This digital portfolio presents evidence of my **Work Integrated Learning (WIL)** experience completed as part of my Diploma in ICT in Multimedia Applications at CPUT. 

Although I **did not receive formal industry placement**, I successfully completed a **project-based WIL experience**, which is an approved alternative model of Work Integrated Learning. The project involved the development of a real-world website for a primary school and provided practical exposure to industry-relevant tools, teamwork, and web development processes.

## Work Integrated Learning (WIL) Experience – Project-Based Learning

### WIL Placement Status

I did not obtain industry placement during my WIL period. Instead, I participated in a **group-based WIL project** designed to simulate a real industry environment. This project required collaboration, task allocation, use of development technologies, and delivery of a functional website for a real client.

## WIL Project Overview

The WIL project involved designing and developing a website for **Cisira Combined Primary School**. The purpose of the website was to provide information about the school, improve online presence, and allow visitors to engage with the school through contact and donation features.

- **Live Website Link (Group Project):**  
  https://sim-99.github.io/Group2-website/

The website consists of multiple pages, including Home, About, Academics, Donations, and Contact pages.

## Individual Role and Contribution

### Assigned Role: About Page Developer

My primary responsibility in this WIL project was the **design and development of the About page**. This page plays a critical role in communicating the identity and background of the school to the public.

- **Direct Link to My Page (About Page):**  
  https://sim-99.github.io/Group2-website/about.html

My responsibilities included:
- Designing the structure and layout of the About page  
- Presenting the school’s background (*Our Story*)  
- Communicating the school’s mission and values (*Our Mission*)  
- Organising institutional information (*School Policies*)  
- Presenting staff and organisational structure (*Our Team*)  
- Ensuring consistency with the website’s navigation and overall design  

This contribution demonstrates my individual involvement and responsibility within the WIL project.

## Tools and Technologies Used

During the completion of this project-based WIL experience, I applied the following technologies and tools:

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – code editor and development environment 
- **HTML5** – page structure and semantic content  
- **CSS3** – styling, layout, and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript** – adding interactivity and functionality  
- **Document Object Model (DOM)** – manipulating page elements dynamically  
- **GitHub** – version control and collaboration  
- **GitHub Pages** – deployment of a live website  

The use of these tools reflects exposure to **industry-relevant development practices**.

## Justification of WIL Experience

Despite the absence of formal industry placement, this project meets the objectives of Work Integrated Learning by:
 - Applying theoretical knowledge in a practical context  
 - Simulating real-world workplace conditions  
 - Encouraging teamwork and professional communication  
- Delivering a functional product for a real client  

The live website link, individual page contribution, screenshots, and structured reflections provide clear and sufficient evidence of meaningful WIL engagement.
